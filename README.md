Go! Code!
======

A Social Coding Experiment in Golang inspired by [socode.git](git@github.com:sricola/socode.git).

Four steps, fork -> edit -> open a pull -> merge

Our goals:
- Do as many cool things as possible in about 3 seconds of runtime.
- Learn us some golang for great good!
- Create something to show childern how awesome programming is!

Our rules:
- Any function you create must be prefixed by your github name
- Anyone can edit anyone else's function.
- Remember to keep it kid safe.

FAQ:
> 3 seconds on what computer?

Take your best guess on how your computer compares to average.

> How will 3 seconds be a enforced?

If your cool function needs more time then steal it from some
one else's function! Maybe reduce the ammount of work they do
or optimize it. We are all in this together so I trust you.

> Are mergers guardians of the codebase?

No. People with direct commit access are just more powerful
automergers. It is your job to maintain the code. So if you
notice a typo in someone's function please do not hesitate to
fix it for them.

> What license are we commiting under?

MIT. I am a copyleft guy but for this endeavor a
liberal license will work best.
